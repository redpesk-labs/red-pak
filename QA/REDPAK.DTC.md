The component redpesk-labs/red-pak is here denoted as *REDPAK*.

This document list the tests ensuring conformance to design
of *REDPAK* (@REDPAK.DSG) are fulfilled.

## Integration tests

### Configuration tests

Tests checking correctness of configuration parsing.

.TYPE integration

#### Description

The configuration tests are checking that configuration files are
correctly handled.

The methodology is to create rednodes with tuned configuration
and to ask *REDCONF* to display that configuration.

The output of *REDCONF* is compared to a validated reference
for that given configuration.

The conf tests are located in directory `tests/conf/`. It contains:

- `do-conf-tests.sh`: script that run tests and emits results
- `data/`: directory containing test definitions
- `conf-tests.tap`: last recorded TAP output

In directory `tests/conf/data`, a file `X-input` is the
configuration file of **test-conf-X** and the file
`X-reference` is its expected output (after filtering
out of variable parts of the output).

### Basic tests

.TEST-CASE REDPAK.DTC-T-BAS-TES

Tests checking inheritance composition of basic settings.

.TYPE integration

#### Overview

These tests are checking options passed to bubble wrap.
They check:

- that configuration files are resulting in correct options
- that options resulting of merged configuration of layered *REDNODE*s
  is correct according to rules of composition

These tests are numerous and their expected results were validated
by a human. It can serve as non-regression test.

#### Methodology

For many pair of configuration's settings, including the null setting
(null setting is given by a configuration file having only the section
*headers*), five compositions *REDNODE*s are made and for each one the normal
and admin options are checked.

Let say the 2 settings are A and B. The 5 *REDNODE*s built for the pair are:

| case | Root Normal | Root Admin | Sub Normal | Sub Admin |
|------|-------------|------------|------------|-----------|
|  1   |    A        |    B       |     -      |    -      |
|  2   |    A        |   NULL     |     B      |   NULL    |
|  3   |    A        |   NULL     |    NULL    |    B      |
|  4   |   NULL      |    A       |     B      |   NULL    |
|  5   |   NULL      |    A       |    NULL    |    B      |

In the case 1, only one *REDNODE* is built for evaluation: the root *REDNODE*.

In other cases, the evaluated *REDNODE* is built on top of a root
*REDNODE*.

For each case, *REDWRAP* is called one time for normal mode and one time for admin
mode with the option `--dump-only` that only outputs the arguments of invocation of
bubblewrap.

- *case 1*: checks how normal and admin setting work in the same *REDNODE*
- *case 2*: checks how normal setting changes parent's normal setting
- *case 3*: checks how admin setting changes parent's normal setting
- *case 4*: checks how paren's admin setting changes normal setting
- *case 5*: checks how admin setting changes parent's admin setting


#### Description

The basic tests are located in directory `tests/basic/`. It contains:

- `do-basic-tests.sh`: script that run tests and emits results
- `gen-confs.sh`: script that generate all configuration files
- `references/`: directory containing expected results
- `basic-tests.tap`: last recorded TAP output

The test is run by the script `do-basic-tests.sh`.
It produces 3 artifact directories and a TAP output:

- `configs/`: directory containing the used configurations
- `rednodes/`: directory containing the created *REDNODE*s
- `results/`: directory containing the results of individuals tests

The results are files, each result is for one couple of settings and
contains the outputs of the 10 'pseudo' invocations of bubblewrap by *REDWRAP*.

The results and the references are named using the pattern `A__B` where A and B are
the settings as described above.

Currently available settings are:

| settings                        | settings                   |

| config-share_net-unset          | export-publicfile-A        |

| config-share_time-enabled       | export-restrictedfile-B    |
| config-share_time-unset         | export-symlink-A           |
| config-share_user-disabled      | export-symlink-B           |
| config-share_user-enabled       | export-tmpfs-A             |
| config-share_user-unset         | export-tmpfs-B             |
| config-umask-027                | NULL                       |
| config-umask-077                |                            |

If fully implemented, the composition matrix would be huge: 7225
entries. But because many of these settings are unrelated one with
another, it is possible to only check the subset of pairs of settings
requiring application of merge rules.

This leads to a total of 293 meaningful pairs.

See Appendice A for details.

### Live tests

.TEST-CASE REDPAK.DTC-T-LIV-TES

Test that *REDWRAP* isolates correctly applications.

.TYPE integration

#### Description

Live tests are done by running a program in a given configuration.

One live test is performed by applying the below steps:

1. setup the *REDNODE* using configuration files for the test
2. optionally compile the program that must run in *REDNODE*
3. optionally copy the program in *REDNODE* filesystem
4. run the program or the command in the setup *REDNODE*
   using *REDWRAP*.
5. compares the output with the expected validated reference.

The live tests are located in directory `tests/live/`. It contains:

- `do-live-tests.sh`: script that run tests and emits results
- `data/`: directory containing test definitions
- `live-tests.tap`: last recorded TAP output

Definition of test **X** in `tests/conf/data` is using the
the files:

- `X-desc`: description of the test, the first line is the title
  of the test.

- `X-normal.yaml` and/or `X-admin.yaml`, the configuration of
  the tested *REDNODE*. When `X-normal.yaml` doesn't exists the
  file `0-normal.yaml` is used. When `X-admin.yaml` doesn't exists
  the file `0-admin.yaml` is used.

- `X-prog` or `X-prog.c` the program to execute in the node.
  When a C program is given, it is compiled statically using
  current C compiler: `cc`.

- `X-reference` the expected out put of the test (after filtering
  out of variable parts of the output).

#### REDNODEs are empty by default

.TEST-CASE  basically-nothing

A minimal configuration leads to a *REDNODE* containing nothing.
This is achieved by *REDWRAP/BWRAP* by entering an empty mount namespace.

But is there is really nothing then it can not execute any program.
For this reason, *busybox* is the only thing installed in the node.
