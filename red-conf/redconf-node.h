 ** Redpath hierachie

    -'root' path='/' -> alias='coreos'
    -'node' path=${redroot}/xxxxxx -> alias=(template, plateform, ....)
    -'leaf' same as node but without decendants (typically a projet)
    -'family' every nodes in direct line from a leaf to root node.

 ** export visibility

    -'private' visible only with one node/leaf
    -'restricted' visible from all descendants in readonly
    -'public' visible from all descendants in writemode

    Note: when sibling node need to share data, then need to use ancestor (public/restricted directories)
